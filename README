Kelley Kelley HW05: WebGL

Time spent: 6 hours

You can view the homework at https://777aker.github.io/GraphicsHW05/hw05.html

Based on example 7. Added lighting
Formatted an obj file into vertex, normal, color, texture
because couldn't figure out how to load a text file
realized a little too late though that they don't quite
work how I thought they did and I'd need to also
look at the f row in the obj file and point everything
to the right spot which is a bit much for 3000 vertices
Controls:
    mouse click to rotate the object
    wasd to move to light around (only in yz direction)
    m switch between objects
    n change draw mode (I just thought this was fun)
